THIS PROJECT IS AN ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE FILES FROM AN IDEA THAT IS BEING CREATED WITHIN MY HEAD. NOTHING AT THE MOMENT IS SOLID YET.

Universe Description: Before the breach, this universe was void and empty of life.  Thankfully, this universe holds some rather unique properties which allows magic to flow in via an astral link from it's parallel sister universe.  Thus, powerful magic has rapidly entered in, creating a universe filled to the brim with a multi-ton of habitable planets.  The infusion of magic caused by the breach has resulted in a plethora of interesting species, intuitive architecture, unique arts and cultures, and a whole slew of natural occurrences unheard of in most universes.  Powerful magic prevails, and there are many special entities which have been gifted the ability to channel this magic in unique ways.  The time, location, and events which trigger the gift in an entity is unknown, and the gifting can be a spectacular occurence or unknown to the entity until many years or even decades later.  It can affect entities of nearly unlimited types: humanoids, animals, plants, elements, and structures such as a house, vehicle, or bridge; in rare instances, it has even been known to affect commonplace objects such as books or clothing.

Starting World Description: The story begins on a large planet roughly twice the size of Jupiter.  The planet, ..., is named for the race of it's primary inhabitants.

Genre: high fantasy, sci-fi
